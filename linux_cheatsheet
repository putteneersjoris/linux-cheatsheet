$ cd 									(change directory) 
$ cd 									(if you only type this, you will get to your home dir)
$ pwd 									(print name of current work directory)


----------folders----------

$ mkdir "name" 							(make name fodler where you are currently at)
$ rmdir "name" 							(remove folder with that name)

----------files----------

$ cat 									(open files)
$ nano 									(edit files)
$ touch "name" 							(make a file in the current dir with that name. It only creates a file if it does not already exist)
$ rm "name"								(remove the "name" file)
$ rm *.txt								(remove all files with .txt extension)
$ cp "oldname" "newname"				(copy the file, and give it the "newname")
$ mv "oldname" "folder"/"newname"		(move a file called "name", into a folder called "folder")
$ mv "oldname" "newname"				(move the "oldname" file in the same dir but change the name to "newname" + it deletes the old "oldname" file)
				
$ grep "word" "file"					(search for a "word" inside a "file" in that specific directory)
$ diff "file1" "file2"					(shows the difference between 2 files)	

ls > "name"								(take the output of "ls" and store it in a file called "name". if this operation happens again, it will overwrite previously existing data)

$ ls 									(shows files)
$ ls -l 								(shows detailsof files)
$ ls -a 								(hidden . files)

----------file permissions----------

example: let's analyze file permissions of a folder and a file
$ cd Desktop
$ ls -l
	"-rw-rw-r-- 1 joris joris 2616 Mär 16 22:43 linux_cheatsheet"
	"drwxrwxr-x 2 joris joris 4096 Mär 17 11:13 newfolder"
	
	first symbol can be "-" (file) or "d" (folder)
	3 blocks of 3 symbols: - rw- rw- r--  or  d rwx rwx r-x 
	1st block "rw-" is a permission describing what the owner(u)  can do
	2nd block "rw-" is a permission describing what the group(g)  can do
	3rd block "rw-" is a permission describing what  everyone(o)  can do

	"r" = read
	"w" = write
	"x" = execute

	"u" = user
	"g" = gorup
	"o" = other users from outside
$ chmod										(command to change the file and folder permissions)

example:
$ chmod	o+w test							(changes permission: it adds a write permission to "test" to the third block (other people))
$ chmod u-x test							(changes permission: it subtracts a execute permission to "test" to the first block (users))
