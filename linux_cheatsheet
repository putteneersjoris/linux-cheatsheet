$ info echo								(dipslays information about the command "echo". You can get out by clicking ctrl+z)
$ neofetch 								(get acces to pc settings such as kernel, ram etc)
$ clear 								(clears cluttered terminal)
$ passwd								(changed the current password)
$ echo "test"							(displays "test" on the screen)
$ echo $test   							(displays the variable "test") 
										(a variable is a placeholder that stores a value in a container with a name. a variable can be a string, a value, a file etc)
$ echo my name is $test					(displays "my name is" with the variable tect)



$ sudo 						 			(super user do)
$ sudo apt 								(Advanced Package Tool)
$ sudo apt-get update					(Update apt)
$ sudo apt install 						(install a package through super user)


---------shell script----------

$ bash name.sh							(run a shell script named name.shell)

-h 										(help)
-v 										(version)

ctrl + c								(kill program)
$ ps									(show processes)


$ cd 									(change directory) 
$ cd 									(if you only type this, you will get to your home dir)
$ pwd 									(print name of current work directory)


----------folders----------

$ mkdir "name" 							(make name fodler where you are currently at)
$ rmdir "name" 							(remove folder with that name)
$ rm -r "name								(removes the folder and it's content. -r = recursivly)

----------files----------
$ xdg-open								(open files with the native program. example: ".hip" files will automatically open with houdini)
$ cat 									(open files)
$ nano 									(edit files)
$ touch "name" 							(make a file in the current dir with that name. It only creates a file if it does not already exist)
$ rm "name"								(remove the "name" file)
$ rm *.txt								(remove all files with .txt extension)
$ cp "oldname" "newname"				(copy the file, and give it the "newname")
$ mv "oldname" "folder"/"newname"		(move a file called "name", into a folder called "folder")
$ mv "oldname" "newname"				(move the "oldname" file in the same dir but change the name to "newname" + it deletes the old "oldname" file)
				
$ grep "word" "file"					(search for a "word" inside a "file" in that specific directory)
$ diff "file1" "file2"					(shows the difference between 2 files)	

ls > "name"								(take the output of "ls" and store it in a file called "name". if this operation happens again, it will overwrite previously existing data)
ls >> "name"							(append the data from ls to the content of the "name" file)


$ ls 									(shows files)
$ ls -l 								(shows detailsof files)
$ ls -a 								(hidden . files)
$ ls -la 								(shows hidden files + details)

----------file permissions----------

example: let's analyze file permissions of a folder and a file
$ cd Desktop
$ ls -l
	"-rw-rw-r-- 1 joris joris 2616 Mär 16 22:43 linux_cheatsheet"
	"drwxrwxr-x 2 joris joris 4096 Mär 17 11:13 newfolder"
	
	first symbol can be "-" (file) or "d" (folder)
	3 blocks of 3 symbols: - rw- rw- r--  or  d rwx rwx r-x 
	1st block "rw-" is a permission describing what the owner(u)  can do
	2nd block "rw-" is a permission describing what the group(g)  can do
	3rd block "rw-" is a permission describing what  everyone(o)  can do

	"r" = read
	"w" = write
	"x" = execute

	"u" = user
	"g" = gorup
	"o" = other users from outside

$ chmod										(command to change the file and folder permissions)

example:
$ chmod	o+w test							(changes permission: it adds a write permission to "test" to the third block (other people))
$ chmod u-x test							(changes permission: it subtracts a execute permission to "test" to the first block (users))

this is a good way of setting indivdual perimission but it takes a while, we don't have tilme for that.
there are shortcuts to give permissions. example:

$ chmod 754 test
7,5,4 respresents the individual blocks for user, group and other.

4 stands for "read"
2 stands for "write"
1 stands for "execute"
0 stands for "no permission"

but there is no 7?

7 is 4+2+1 which means	: I give the user perimission to read, write and execute this file
5 is 4+1   which means	: I give the group permission to read and execute this file
4 					  	: I give the other perimission to read this file

common cases are:
chmod 777 test			: I give permission to everyone to do everything






----------compressing and decompressing files & directories----------

#single files

$ gzip "name"							(compress the "name" file, and adds it to a new file called "name.gz")
$ gunzip "name.gz"						(decompresses the "name.gz" file)

#multiple files

$ tar cvf  name.tar	file1.txt file2.txt			(create a compressed tar file "name.tar" with the files: file1.txt & file2.txt. c = create something, v = display that in the terminal, f = file-options)
$ tar xvf name.tar								(extract the "name.tar" file. x = extract)


----------tips n tricks----------

autocompletion of files: if you give the first few letters of a file and press "TAB", ubuntu will figure out what file it is tjat you want
spaces in naming conventions: whenever you have a space in you name: "grocery list" becomes "grocery\ list" the "\" symbol tell subuntu: whatever character comes after, read is as a " ", and not a new command
----------gotcha's----------

linux is capital sensitive
you can cycle trhough previous commands by using up and down arrows

ctrl(right)+f 							(go into full ubuntu screen)
